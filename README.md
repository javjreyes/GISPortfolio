Dear Visitor,

Thank you for viewing my portfolio. This is a small collection of some of the recent GIS projects I've worked on.

Best,

#Project Background
My GIS journey began in high school where I had the good fortune of meeting a teacher who integrated GIS into his geography course as well as a handful of electives. I have since appreciated the ability of GIS to aid in the observation and analysis of trends and events at a range of scales from local to global. Through college, career experience, and personal exploration, I have continued to learn about the different uses of GIS both on the job and in my personal life. 

The majority of the works hosted in this web project have been inspired by my search for housing in Baltimore, while the remainder focus on my birth place of Puerto Rico. These projects are intended to showcase some of my favorite uses of GIS tools as well as permitting me to explore and continue developing my understanding of the ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, and AutoCAD Civil 3D tools as well as their respective capabilities and limitations.
